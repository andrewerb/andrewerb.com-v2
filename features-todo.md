# Features / To-Do:

- Better SEO practices.
- Revised HTML markup (because I kind of know what I'm doing now).
- Static site generator.
- Updated libraries, such as FontAwesome 5.
- Better mobile styles and Nav.
- SCSS style revisions.
- Better build process.
- SVG failover.
- Blog migration to Github pages.
- Better package management & environment setup.
- All around nicer looking site and stuff. :sunglasses:
- Ellegant CSS loading animations & transitions.
- More features to come as well.
- Versioning! (For no significant reason).
- Slight and tedious shifts in color that nobody but Andrew will even care about.
- New fonts? Probably? Maybe?
- SSL encryption (which is not on a code level).
- Use of frontend precompiled build tools.
- Testing.
- Webpack

Expect much of this site to look the same. Just better and cleaner code for me to maintain, with slightly updated frontend tools.
